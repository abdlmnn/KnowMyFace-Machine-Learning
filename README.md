# KnowMyFace-Machine-Learning
It is all about face recognition and name labeling

This project is a Python-based face registration tool that captures 5 face images from a webcam, detects faces using OpenCV's Haar Cascades, and generates embeddings using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature descriptors. Each embedding is stored in a SQLite database along with the person's name for future face recognition applications.
